            <h3><u>DCX</u></h3>
            <div>
                DCX is a new Decentralized Web Node (DWN) protocol that securely and privately facilitates the
                decentralized exchange of a user's verifiable credentials for different verifiable credential. The npm
                package implements each side of the protocol along with a common library and a server. For more
                information about DCX, check out the following links:
