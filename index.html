        <p>
            FormFree empowers consumers to understand their ability to pay and share it with lenders like never before.
            Using FormFree's <a target="_blank" href="https://formfree.com/passport/">Passport app</a>, consumers can
            share all the core financial data required by loan underwriters — including identity, assets, income,

        </p>
        <p>
            Once consumers are ready to transact, they can anonymously share their data on the <a target="_blank"
                href="https://formfree.com/ffx/">FormFree Exchange (FFX)</a> and receive immediate offers from a
            marketplace of lenders who fully understand their ability to pay, residual income and eligibility for

            <h5>DCX</h5>
            <div>
                DCX is a new Decentralized Web Node (DWN) protocol that securely and privately facilitates the
                decentralized exchange of a user's verifiable credentials for different verifiable credential. The npm
                package implements each side of the protocol along with a common library and a server. For more
                information about DCX, check out the following links:
